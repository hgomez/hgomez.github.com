Gildas and I create a project on GoogleCode where we'll maintain build/package scripts and provide packages.

My Dropbox download page was overloaded and we needed another location, here is it :

[http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/](http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/)

Contributors are very welcome, especially OS/X gurus
